about w9wm:

w9wm is an improved version of 9wm, the excellent 8-1/2 window manager emulation. It supports virtual screens as well as keybindings.
It is free software, under 9wm license although I would prefer to ship it under the GNU GPL (as most of w9wm's code is borrowed from 9wm, I have to keep the same license). Please have a look at README for more information.
Current stable version is 0.4.2
